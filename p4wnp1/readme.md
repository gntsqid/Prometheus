# P4WNP1 ALOA
So apparently I messed up as I can not find any documentation on this...\
Actually on second thought it may be in the netsec org.

Anyway, to start grab an image from [here](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa/releases/tag/v0.1.1-beta).
> Make sure to unzip it then attach it to an SD card with Balena or Rufus.
