Welcome to my devlog within the world of electronics.\
Only tangible hardware projects go in here, meaning everything includes physical components that I have put together and ran successfully.\
<br></br>
The majority of the code is written with Python and for Raspberry Pi products.\
Some outliers require the Arduino IDE such as the ESP32-WROOM.
